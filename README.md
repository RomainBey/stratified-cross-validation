# stratified-cross-validation
Stratified cross-validation is a new validation methodology presented in the paper "Stratified cross-validation for unbiased and privacy-preserving federated learning".
It enables the unbiased validation of a model that has been trained on a multi-centric dataset using federated learning, while avoiding the transfer of personally identifying information out of the centers.
In this jupyter notebook, Monte Carlo simulations are run to study the properties of stratified cross-validation.
